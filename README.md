# Portfolio

## My professional portfolio

## Purpose

My portfolio is created to display my skills and talents and highlight my work using HTML and CSS.
I created my portfolio using semantic HTML,flexbox/grid, mediaqueries, and CSS variables.  
The portfolio also contains deployed web applications of my work and meets accessibility standards.
Web accessible websites are advantageous because they are optimized for search engines,
and are therefore better positioned for people to view.
